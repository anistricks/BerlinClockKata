# BerlinClockKata
Hello we are going to do the Berlin Clock Kata, for this we will use the following conventions: Y=yellow R=red O=off

Unfortunately we had problems with github and we had to do this on a pc each in turn.

We started by writing the simple tests then wrote the minimal code to pass the test then commit and so on, 
then we did the same with the more complex tests and had to refactor to improve the code and 
finally we included the clock as a string and refactor to simplify everything.
